## What is Smart Rules 

Smart rules is a feature that is still in development. It allows you add useful smart rule snippet. 

## What's Locked mode and How does it affect my database access ? 

Locked mode basically is a feature that allows no read or write access to your database. If a particular `path/location` rule is set to locked mode, it means no one will be able to write and read data from that location in your database. 

## is there difference between Locked access and Locked mode?

Yes, there is a big difference between the two. `Locked Access` stops  access specific to either read or write; while `locked mode` controls access to the whole database location/path.



## Why Do we need  to add our user id to the app and is it compulsory? 

Adding your user id or uid while creating your database project in Ruleguard is not compulsory, it is totally optional. We only added it to ensure smooth running of the app. Although its is necessary to prevent retyping the same uid when you want to use it; Not Adding it wont cause your generated database rule to be altered. 

## How do i rename a particular path/Location

At the time of writing this documentation, editing/renaming path is not supported. But we are working on it
