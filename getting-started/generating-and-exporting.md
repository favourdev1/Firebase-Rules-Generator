# Generating And Exporting

After writing your database rules, saving is just a click away.

By default, if you mistakenly press the back button, you will be prompted to know if you want to save your rule. 

You can disable this prompt by enabling  `auto save` in settings.

### Generating Your Database Rule 

To generate your database rule, you navigate to the homepage where all projects are listed  then  click on the `option bar`&gt;&gt;  `project` &gt;&gt; `Extract Rule.`
